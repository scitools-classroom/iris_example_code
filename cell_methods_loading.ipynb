    "\n",
    "Iris can constrain the loading of data to a subset of the entire dataset based on metadata interpreted on the Iris Cube. This includes the ability to constrain based on the cube's cell methods, if present. These cell methods represent operations already applied to the data, describing climatological and diurnal statistics.  Available methods include point, sum, mean, maximum, minimum, mid_range, standard_deviation, variance, mode, and median.  Along with an associated coordinate, an interval is often defined.  An example cell method might be a *time mean of two hours*.  Here the method is \"mean\", \"time\" is the coordinate name and an interval of two hours indicates that the time mean is over a two hour interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "This worked example shows how to constrain the loading of cubes dependent on whether they have one or more cell methods present."
